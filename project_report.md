### **1. Introduction**

This project is a real-time crypto price tracker built using **Python** and **Streamlit.** It helps users see the live prices of top **cryptocurrencies** and get email alerts when prices go above or below set limits. The goal was to make a clean and easy-to-use app for both learners and crypto users.



### **2. Abstract**

  **-->** **The main idea of the project is to:**



  **==> Track live crypto prices (like Bitcoin,  Ethereum).**



  **==> Show charts of last 30 days price movement.**



  **==> Allow users to set price alerts and get emails.**



  **==> Use free APIs and tools.**



  **==> This project is useful for people who want to keep an eye on crypto prices without checking apps again and again.**



#### **3. Tools/Tech Used**

* **Python	-** Main programming language
* **Streamlit -** Web UI framework
* **CoinGecko API -** Get real-time crypto data
* **MailerSend SMTP  -** Send email alerts
* **Plotly \& Pandas -** Data display and charts
* **GitHub \& VS Code -** Code editing and version control



#### **4. Steps Followed**

* **Setup Python environment and install all libraries.**
* **Connected to CoinGecko API to fetch live prices.**
* **Used Streamlit to build web UI with crypto cards.**
* **Created graphs to show 30-day price trends.**
* **Added a form to set alerts (coin + price + email).**
* **Used MailerSend SMTP to send alerts via email.**
* **Styled the app with basic CSS and hover effects.**
* **Uploaded project to GitHub and tested alerts.**



#### **5. Conclusion**

* **This project gave hands-on experience in:**
* **Working with APIs**
* **Sending emails using SMTP**
* **Building dashboards in Streamlit**
* **Using GitHub for project hosting**
* **The tracker is simple but effective and can be improved by adding features like login, portfolio tracking, or more charts.**
