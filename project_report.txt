ðŸ”¹ 1. introduction
This project is a real-time crypto price tracker built using Python and Streamlit. It helps users see the live prices of top cryptocurrencies and get email alerts when prices go above or below set limits. The goal was to make a clean and easy-to-use app for both learners and crypto users.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Abstract
The main idea of the project is to:

==> Track live crypto prices (like Bitcoin,  Ethereum).

==> Show charts of last 30 days price movement.

==> Allow users to set price alerts and get emails.

==> Use free APIs and tools.

==> This project is useful for people who want to keep an eye on crypto prices without checking apps again and again.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Tools Used
Tool/Tech	Use
Python	Main programming language
